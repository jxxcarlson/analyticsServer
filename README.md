# Analytics Server

The purpose of this server is to log POST requests with JSON data like

```
{"userName":  "jxxcarlson", "eventName":  "login", "eventTime":  12234.77}'
```

The route for these requests is `/analytics`.  The  server will also accept
`GET /analytics/hello`, responding with *Yes, I am alive*.

The app is written in Haskell:

```
$ stack build
$ stack run
```

## Testing the app

```
  $ curl -d '{"userName":  "jxxcarlson", "eventName":  "login", "eventTime":  12234.77}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:8080/analytics
```


## Postgres

Postgres is installed at `/usr/local/var/postgres`

```
 $ createdb --username=jxx --password forscotty
 $ dropdb forscotty
```

To start postgress, use `brew services start postgresql`.
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run`pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start`

Make a Postgres user with `createuser -s test -W`

## Development references

The reference on which this app is based is [Rest api in Haskell](https://mcksp.com/rest-api-in-haskell). A simple,
straightforward approach.  I had also looked at the following:
